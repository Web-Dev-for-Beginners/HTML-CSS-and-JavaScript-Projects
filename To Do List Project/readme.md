# TO-DO List
# OBJECTIVE
The main of this project is to build a TO-DO List using HTML ,CSS, JS.

# What task does it do? How did you implement that?
● As we will enter the list of work one by one (for ex: wake at 5:00 am in
the morning, do exercise, eat healthy breakfast , go for tuition, then lunch
, go to college, study etc..) , this will get added by the help of add button.
● This all the tasks which are yet to be performed will be displayed into the
not completed section which have remove and completed option in it.
● As the remove option is selected the task will get removed/deleted.
● As the completed option will get selected the task will be further moved
into the completed section.
● Lastly the Completed task in the completed section can be removed
by remove option.

I implement this by using HTML,CSS,JS
