# how to play Sudoku game :
I know almost 80% of you know how to play a sudoku game and the rest 20% can google it but just to fill this Readme file and also for those 20% people I will tell you how to play this game. In this game, there is a grid of 81 (9x9) cells i.e 9 cells in a row and 9 cells in a column. Also, 9 subgrids contain 9 cells (3x3) each. There are some cells pre-filled (called hints) depending upon the level of difficulty. Now we have to fill the grid with numbers 1-9 keeping in mind that no number can be repeated in a row, column & sub grid. In case you find this explanation difficult to understand, feel free to google it and read a better description!
